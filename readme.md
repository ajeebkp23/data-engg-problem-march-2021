# Instructions
Mentioned below is the task for Data Engineering evaluation. 
Requesting to submit at the earliest.


The Task

Read the PDF file attached and parse the data to a JSON file with subheadings as key and content as value. Use libraries as required, even though you consider reducing the dependency. A sample JSON output is also attached.

Note:
Adding unit tests and increasing data granularity will give you an additional point.
The input file name and output file name should read from the command line.

Please drop a reply to this email with the solution and share a git link for us to evaluate. Once this is done, we would be scheduling a call to discuss more and take this forward. 

### Note
Provided `sample_data.json` is renamed and committed to this repo with name `sample_data0.json`. A new file `sample_data.json` will be generated on successfull running of the code as explained below.

# Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
# Run
Eg:
